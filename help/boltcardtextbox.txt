______________________________________________________________________


----------- Show LN Hub login -----------
Login credential to your external (custodial) lightnig wallet. The Bitcoin blockchain is used "pseudo anonymous". Meaning that the transactions are not anonymous but WHO is doing the transaction is (or can be).
In the same way can the Lightning transactions done with a Boltcard be pseudo anonymous. The important this is how you login to your account at the LN Hub provider and how you refill the card with new sats.
It is recommended that you use a TOR-browser to access your account at all times.


---------- Program (smartcard) ----------
Use the Bolt app on play/app-store. The codes etc that is transfered to the Boltcard during programming is inpart based on the serial number (called UID) of the card. The codes etc needed can only be generated by the LN Hub software (after the correct UID has been sent to them). You can scan the Boltcard for the UID using a generic NFT-app found in the play/app-store.


------- Export card data to file -------
This can be usefull when you want to give your card to somebody else or you want to move it somewhere.


----- Load via Lightning Network ------
Scan the QR-code with an online LN wallet to transfer sats to the Boltcard. Boltcards are for small transactions when you want to spend Bitcoin to buy a beer or coffee and don't want to risk privacy or theft of bigger amount. Or you want to quick and easy transfer small amount here and there without picking up you phone and logging into an app etc

 
Refill your Boltcard with onchain Bitcoin
------------------------------------------------------
Login to your LN Hub account (for privacy use TOR-browser) and activate the extension called "Boltz". 
Select "ONCHAIN TO LN". Select the LN Hub wallet, fill in your details, select "Receive specified Amount". Get a refund BTC address from one of your onchain wallet and paste it in. Click "CREATE SWAP (IN)". Scan the Bitcoin onchain address that comes up to start the swap. A swap from onchain to lightning done this way can take 10-20 minutes before confirming and your sats shows up in the LN Hub wallet.
Now you can spend them via the Boltcard anonymously!!
