
Digital ID (and Nostr)
-----------------------------
In the digital age, your digital ID is everything. You don't allow the government to install codelocks on all your doors and then receive an electronic key that only works when they allow it. Similarly, a digital ID can be used for surveillance and control. Maybe it was the party that you voted for that won the election last time, and you like the controls, rules and restrictions. But maybe they lose the next election?
Mass surveillance combined with centralized control over people's IDs and money transactions creates a honeypot for sociopaths and criminals. People and groups that want to control and have power over others will do and say anything to get to be that politician, banker, etc. History has proven this.  
After an individual has generated her or his own ID (offline and securely) it's possible to send the public part of the key used for the ID to a government, company or organization etc for "signing/validating". It can then be uploaded, by the individual himself/herself to any number of public keyservers. When someone want to verify your identity they can simply scan a printed out copy of the ID, or a copy you have in your phone, and that will link to the pubic keyservers. If you you have the correct/needed signature(s) you are good. 

Creating a digital ID
-----------------------------
First, make sure that you have created an encryption key that you would like to use with the new ID being created. Then click "New ID" in the top left corner of the ID-menu. Insert the data as required (name and address, etc.). Have an appropriate photo ready to upload when instructed. The photo data size should be as small as possible (as it will be included in the key itself).  
The dimensions of the photo should be 500 x 653 pixels and have good clarity. For more information, please check the local requirements. Only JPEG format is OK (ending with .jpg). 


General use 
-----------------------------
First of all, don't create an ID using the key that encrypts/decrypts the offline device itself. It's good practice to create ID's in a specific order. The first ID is for main/general use, the second could be for professional use and third for gaming or anonymously using the web etc.
Get signatures from trusted sources. Merge them with the key using the offline device and then export a new public part of the ID/key (see below). This can then be distributed and used for communication, verification and identification purposes. Remember, it's YOU that has control over your own digital ID. After creating new ID it's important that you make one or more backups.

Get validating signatures.
To increase the trust in your ID it is good to get verification, or signatures, from many trusted sources. In this way somebody who doesn't know you directly can look and see what other institutions, companies and individuals have verified your key and then hopefully trust its legitimacy.


Make the key that you use for the digital ID known.
-----------------------------
To make others aware of your key, you can attach it to all your emails, post it on your website and put your unique key fingerprint on your social media profiles.
There are public keyservers that you can use to upload your public key. In that way, anyone finding your key's ID or fingerprint (in your emails, on your social media profile or homepage etc) can either click on a link to get to the key on the public server or go there manually and search for it.
The most known public keyservers are:
* keys.openpgp.org
* https://keyserver.ubuntu.com
* pgp.mit.edu


Sending your public key to a keyserver
-----------------------------
Use a GPG- client program or use the command "gpg --keyserver <key-server> --send-keys <key-id or fingerprint>". When using the "--send-keys" command, the email for the key will not get added. This is good for privacy and makes it more flexible as the email address can change over the years.
Example: gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --send-keys F4FBFC9F52F2713E

Alternatively, export your public key from the offline device to a USB stick and then use an online computer to go to https://keys.openpgp.org/upload (or the keyserver you use). 


Getting a key from a keyserver
-----------------------------
With an online computer, use the command "gpg --keyserver <key-server> --recv-keys <key-id or fingerprint>".

Example: gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --recv-keys B4FAFA9F52F2763E

To move the key to the offline device, you first need to export the public key you downloaded from the local keychain to a file. Use the command "gpg --export --armor <key ID or fingerprint>".
Then copy the generated file to a USB stick and move it to the offline device for import. 
 

Updating your public key on a public keychain (after adding validating signatures or subkeys to it) 
-----------------------------
1. Export a new public key- file from the master key using the offline device.
2. Move the USB to an online computer.
3. Go to https://keys.openpgp.org/upload (or the keyserver you use) and upload the updated public key. Alternatively, first import the key to the online computer's local keychain (gpg --import <key ID>) and then use the command: 
"gpg --keyserver <key-server> --send-keys <key-id or fingerprint>".

Nostr
-----------------------------
Nostr is an open source, decentralized and permissionless social platform (like Twitter but without the company Twitter..). It operates on the principal of two keys. One public (for accessing the accounts data) and one for signing "events" such as a new post/message.
The Offline device has added functionality for creating, storing and export/importing such keys. It also has an interface to transfer the private key to a Nostr Signing device (NSD). 

Creating new keys
-----------------------------
Under the "Digital ID" menu, open up the sub menu "Nostr". When there is an empty slot for a Nostr key, click on "New"- button. This will generate a random public key and one associated private key. Don't forget to backup the device after a new key has been stored.

Importing existing keys
-----------------------------
When there is an empty slot for a Nostr key, click on "Import"- button. This will open up a dialog with instructions on how to copy a file from an USB-device to the Offline device. The file on the USB must be a text file (.txt) containing exactly two lines.
First line is the public key (called "Npub"). The second line in the file is the private key (called "Nsec"). Make sure there is no "new line" after the second line.

Exporting keys
-----------------------------
Exporting the keys from the Offline device can be done in two ways. 
1. When there is a Nostr key available, click on the "QR"- button. This will open up a screen with a QR- code of the key. Scan it with a camera to transfer it to a computer and/or smartphone.
2. When there is a Nostr key available, click on the "Export"- button next to a public key or private key. This will open a dialog box with instructions on how to copy the key to an USB-device. The text file that will e written to the USB-device will have one lines (the Npub or Nsec).   

Transfer a private key to NSD
-----------------------------
When there is a Nostr key available, click on the "NSD"- button. This will open up a new window that have a guide on how to copy the selected private key to a Nostr Signing Device (NSD, a hardware device). The signing device work with Chrome browser.
Before starting to use the NSD it's first needed to install an extension to the Chrome browser. See instructions under Nostr- menu.
