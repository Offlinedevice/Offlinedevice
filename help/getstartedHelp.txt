
Intro 
-----------------------------
The Offline device is a tool for generating and managing encryption keys, setting up a Yubikey 5 NFC (hardware device) and storing files and folders securely using encryption. It is built using standard components and the plastic casing can be printed with a common 3D-printer. The offline device must never be connected to the Internet. All transfers of data to and from the device are done using USB-sticks or scanning QR-codes on the screen. The offline device can: 

  * Generate and use encryption keys (encryption/decryption, authentication, signing of keys and documents, etc).
  * Work as a password manager and backup for account login details, Bitcoin seed words etc.
  * Managing external security key such as the Yubikey 5C NFC (initializing, changing settings, transferring subkeys etc).
  * Store a secure archive that is encrypted on the device and also stored on a USB stick. It can be restored from the USB-backup.
  * Issuing and managing digital ID’s.
  * Generate and store Nostr private and public keys
  * Transfer Nostr keys to a Nostr Signing Device (NSD)
  * Receive and store secure copies of Bolt cards data (load address, reset address and programming keys).
  * Generate and store single BTC wallet key-pair addresses (offline cold storage).
  * Generate and add Bitcoin wallets that can be used with an external signing device (such as Blockstream Jade).
  * Export Xpub from hardware wallets and sign Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT) with connected camera.
    Supported models are ov5647, imx219 and imx708.
  * Keep a statement for each wallet on the device
  * Store details of Passkeys.
  * Encrypt/decrypt messages/texts and check signatures etc.
  * Sign public encryption keys and files.
  * Generate an inheritance package for wallet etc that are on the Offline device


General use
-----------------------------
1. Create an account on the device and generate one or more external encryption key(s). Or import your existing keys to the Offline Device.
Tip: Choose strong passwords. Especially for keys used with Yubikey as there is no need to remember/use them. The Yubikey uses only a PIN to perform cryptographic operations (three failed attempts locks the Yubikey).

2. Store bitcoin wallets, sensitive data, Bolt cards and passwords etc in the secure archive.

3. Make one or more backups on USB-sticks (this includes making a backup for the secret key to decrypt the Offline device itself).
Tip: Store the USB- backups on multiple physical locations for safety. Don't store both the backup file, encryption key and secret password at the same place/with the same person. That would make that person responsible for safe keeping in a way that he/she is probably not able to handle.

4. Export public keys and secret subkeys to files and transfer them to online computers and/or smartphones (for encrypting emails etc).

5. Make a backup whenever important data is added or modified. Or if a new secret encryption key is created.

Never leave the room while logged in to your account. Stealing information is done in a split second and it's more or less impossible to prove who did it.


Data security 
-----------------------------
Keeping data, and bitcoin, in self-custody is a secure alternative to trusting a third party and hoping that you can get to your data/Bitcoin when you need to. Or in case of an emergency. Third party solutions becomes a much bigger target for thives and hackers as they have much more of value to steal!
Encryption is the most efficient and safe way of securing ones data. The important part is that it has to be YOU that generate the encryption keys. And that you do it in a secure and private way (offline). 
Encryption keys that can be generated with the offline device includes FIDO2 passwordsless authentication keys, bitcoin wallets addresses (keys), SSH-communication keys, encryption/decryption keys, Nostr keys and signing keys etc. These keys uses encryption that can't be broken no matter how much resources the attacker has.
For the average individual the threat of data being stolen comes from an online attacker. So keeping the encryption (master) keys offline is very important. You can make a backup and give it to a friend or relative for safe keeping, BUT don't give the same person the secret password. That you give to somebody else for safe keeping. That way the risks are reduced.
The Offline device (the hardware itself) can be manipulated. A spyware or keylogger could be installed without you knowing it. So it's best to keep it locked up in a safe and/or to hide it.


Get started
-----------------------------
First connect a screen using a mini-HDMI connector. The screen resolution should be minimum 1920 x 1080 (HD). Secondly connect a keyboard and mouse. If using a Raspberry PI keyboard and mouse the keyboard layout and language will automatically be detected. After the screen and keybord + mouse have been connected then connect the power cord (its the micro-USB connector at far end). The power supply shall be rated at minimum 2 A output. It is a good idea to use a cord with an in-line switch when connecting the power supply. 
The offline device has a built-in hardware clock (with battery). This allows it to keep the date and time, even if it's not connected to a power supply for long periods. But it is necessary to first set the time and date. Go to the settings page by clicking on the "Settings"- button at the top right corner. Under "Settings" it is also possible to set the background, button colors and avatar etc (if logged in to an account).
On the main page there is a button called "Start". This will give two options. One option is to make a new acount and the other to make an account with an additional key for external communication (in addition to the key used for encrypting/decrypting the offline device itself). Selecting this option will let you configure and load subkeys to an Yubikey 5 (if you have one). 

The option for creating an account is limited to only creating a key for encrypting the offline device itself (maybe you already have a key that you use for emails etc. Or, you like to generate it at some other time or way.


Using the Offline device
-----------------------------
When the setup process is complete and you have a user account you can start adding some files, passwords, wallets, Bolt cards or generate Bitcoin wallets etc. After you're done, simply hit “Close and exit” at the bottom of the screen. This will encrypt all the data before shutting down the device. After keys have been added/modified on the local keychain it's important to “Backup keys” from the GPG menu. It is important to regularly do a backup to one or more USB devices. This can be done with “Backup to USB/SD” under the secure archive menu. It is also possible to clone the entire offline device to an extra microSD-card under the same menu (but only when the secure archive is encrypted). There is a risk that the offline device will get tampered with if somebody gets physical access to it, so keep it hidden and locked away as much as possible. The secret passphrase should be written down at more than one location. Make sure that somebody you trust has knowledge of it in case something happens to you..
Make sure to never leave the device on and unattended with the secure archive decrypted. 
There can be many accounts on an offline device. When logging in, select the correct key/avatar to access your user account. To clone the device you will need an extra microSD-card (min. 32 gb) and a USB-to-microSD adaptor.
Under the Settings-menu it's possible to set the date and time and also to customize your account (theme, colors and user name).
The encrypted information on the device is "hacker proof" once the a user logs out (and it's encrypted). Also, any backups are secure (as the encryption can't be broken, if the password is strong enough..). But make sure that the device itself can't be accessed by an attacker.
